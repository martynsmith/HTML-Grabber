HTML::Grabber
=============

HTML::Grabber provides a jQuery style interface to HTML documents. This makes
parsing and manipulating HTML documents trivially simple for those people
familiar with [jQuery][].

It uses XML::LibXML for DOM parsing/manipulation and HTML::Selector::XPath for
converting CSS expressions into XPath.
